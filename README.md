# testgen
Nodejs utility for generating test code for an Angular project

The goal here is to reduce writing boilerplate code for unit tests. The program will
scan a project and generate setup code, mock objects and method-based tests. It generates
skeleton code that is intended to be augmented.

This is a first version and so things like the input path are hard-coded. Also, the generated
tests are very basic. A future enhancement would be generating more sophisticated tests.
